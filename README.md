```

## Docker

### Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t weather-app .
```

### Run Container
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 weather-app
```

- `builder` - Node.js container that builds the application
- `web` - Nginx container serving the built application
- `db` - PostgreSQL 16 database container (port 5432)

**Stop containers:**
```bash
docker compose down
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
